### Tech Stack
In the SHOWS NOW Movie Ticket Booking System, we used a powerful and modern tech stack. For the backend, we chose **ExpressJS and NodeJS** to build the server-side application and handle all the backend logic. This combination provided us with a robust framework for developing a scalable and efficient web application. We used **MongoDB** as our database to store user information, movie details, and booking data efficiently. On the frontend, we utilized **EJS** as our templating engine to dynamically render HTML content, while **CSS** was employed to style the web pages, ensuring they were visually appealing and user-friendly. To fetch up-to-date movie data, we integrated the **The Movie Database (TMDb) API**, which provided titles, descriptions, ratings, and images. For secure payment processing, we implemented **Razorpay**, which ensured safe and seamless transactions for ticket purchases.

### Features
Our system offers a comprehensive set of features designed to enhance the user experience. We incorporated **user authentication** to provide secure login and registration functionalities, ensuring that only authenticated users can book tickets. We also implemented a **real-time seat selection** feature that allows users to choose their preferred seats with up-to-date availability information. Our **dynamic ticket cost calculation** feature automatically computes the total ticket cost based on the selected movie, showtime, and seat type. To ensure secure and seamless payment processing, we integrated **Razorpay**, which handles online transactions reliably and safely.
